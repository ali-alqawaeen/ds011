    "    <p id=\"para-00023\">This exercise is based the <a href=\"https://openstax.org/r/100madlibs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Vacations Mad Lib</a> available on the <a href=\"https://openstax.org/r/100printable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Printables</a> section of MadLibs.com. Write a program that asks the user to input two adjectives and two nouns (user input in bold):</p>\n",

    "    <p id=\"para-00024\">Use <code data-type=\"code\" class=\"python inline-code\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">input</span>()</code> to display each prompt exactly as shown. The user's input should be on the same line as the prompt. Each colon must be followed by exactly one space. After reading the input, the program should output the following three lines:</p>\n",

    "    Usually you go to some place that is near a/an <strong>pancake</strong> or up on a/an <strong>field</strong>.</pre>\n",
    "    <p id=\"para-00025\">Notice that the first line should be completely blank.  Replace the bold words (from the above example) with the actual words input by the user.</p>\n",
    "    <p id=\"para-00026\">Your final program should have four input statements, three print statements, and at least two comments. For completeness, write an appropriate docstring at the top of the program.</p>\n",
